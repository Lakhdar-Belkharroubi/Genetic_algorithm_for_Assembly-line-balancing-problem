# Genetic_algorithm_for_Assembly-line-balancing-problem

This project is designed for solving a combinatorial problem known in the literature as the Mixed-model assembly line balancing problem type-2. 

Using the genetic algorithm, different solutions can be found for the same problem. Initial feasible solutions are found using "example01.py", and then we use these solutions in the genetic algorithm "example01_GA.py" as initial population. The genetic algorithm by its different steps can find other solutions starting from the initial population and in the final population optimal solutions can be found.
